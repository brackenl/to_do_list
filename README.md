## To Do List
### The Odin Project - [PROJECT: TODO LIST](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list)

The objective of this project was to make a to-do list app with create, read, update and delete functionality and with the ability to persist between browser sessions.

The project consolidates learning on objects, object constructors, factory functions, the module pattern, classes and object-oriented programming principles.
